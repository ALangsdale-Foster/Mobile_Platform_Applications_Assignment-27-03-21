### ITEC31041 Mobile Platform Applications

Now you have completed the design, requirements and paper prototype for your App in the proposal (Coursework1), you are required to individually implement, test and demonstrate your proposed application on the Android platform. For apps that require significant development, you may choose to implement a subset of the features.  However, you should ensure you are producing a useful application that is fit for purpose.
Summary of deliverables:
•	An electronic copy of your zipped Android Studio project file
•	A separate document containing all of the java code, in either word or PDF format. This should be submitted as a separate document, NOT within a zip file.
